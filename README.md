# BurstingAtTheSeamsChallenge

## Description
You are a solutions architect who has just taken over an existing AWS Infrastructure for AnyCompany. You have the design of the current architecture but not any understanding into why decisions were made.

As you begin you note multiple issues with latency and application response times during peak hours of the day. The app is a basic two tier application with an RDS instance hosting a mysql database, a web app running on EC2, behind an Application Load Balancer. You have been given the task of fixing this issue, without incurring additional cost.

## Rubric

* Cloudwatch Dashboards will show reduced latency/response times.
* Billing will show no increased costs, or within $10 a month increase.
* Only concerned with application performance. Not looking at additional optimizations that may exist.
